See the following page for an overview of Project Stages 3-5

At the bottom of the page there are links to Project Stage 3
https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/courses/564/minirel-project/project-stage3.html
To do this project stage, you need to read an overview of the Minirel I/O Layer
https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/courses/564/minirel-project/iolayer.htm

The Zip file for Stage 3 is called part3.zip and can be downloaded by clicking on "Files" in Canvas. 

Submission Instruction

Each project group should create a directory named after their group name. Suppose the group name is G6. Then the directory is "G6". In this directory, please place the file buf.C (which we have asked you to change) and a file G6.txt, which lists the full names and emails of all group members. 

The file G6.txt should also clearly list what tasks each group member has done for this project stage. We expect all group members to participate in this project stage. 

Zip the directory into a file G6.zip, then upload to Canvas. Each group should have just ONE member uploading this zip file. To upload, click on "Assignments", then on Project Stage 3. You should see a button that allows you to upload the zip file. 

The above instruction is for a fictional group named G6. You should modify it accordingly, using your true group name. 

IMPORTANT: 
1) You should have been editing only file buf.C. So you should upload only that file (plus the G6.txt file). We will add your buf.C to our code and compile. Make sure that your code compiles and passes all the tests in testbuf.c ON CS MACHINES, as we will compile your code using CS machines. 

2) You must submit by the deadline. No exception. We need this so that we can release the next stage (which contains the solution to this stage) on time. Even if you have not passed all the tests, just submit what you have by the deadline.
